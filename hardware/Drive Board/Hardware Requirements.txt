- Auto Addressing functionality
 -Use the CD74HC283M96 4 Bit adder to automatically address the boards

- DIP Socket for china-based Arduino Nanos

- Output 3 connections that connect to ground for auto-address

- 3.3 volt regulator for ESP8266 that is rated for 200mA

- Nice spot for board-to-board connectors

- Rounded edges (for fanciness)

- Breakout Arduino Reset (externally, in that there will be a button on the enclosure)

- Indication LEDs
  - (blue) one to indicate WiFi connectivity. Should be designed to be viewed from outside the case (light pipe?)
  - ESP Error LEDs
	- No internet connection
	- No website found (eg, 404, 401 errors)
  - Arduino Error LED
    - Misc error

- Test Points
  - Because this is a prototype device: Add test points to Vin (from jack), 5v, 3v3, RX on the ESP8266 (check that it's receiving 3v3 signals)
